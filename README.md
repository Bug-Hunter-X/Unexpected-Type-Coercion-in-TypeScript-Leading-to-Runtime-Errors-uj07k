This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in TypeScript: unexpected type coercion leading to runtime errors.  The `add` function is declared to accept two numbers, but the code passes a string.  TypeScript does not prevent this, resulting in a runtime error (NaN) instead of a compile-time error.  The solution demonstrates how to use type guards or more robust type checking to prevent such errors.
